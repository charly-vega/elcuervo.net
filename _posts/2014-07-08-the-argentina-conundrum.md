I'm not the smartest cookie in the jar... I know that. I've never tried to
change that.

Don't get me wrong, I have a fair amount of consciousness on what I'm doing but
sometimes you just know that you can get it trouble... I tend to ignore that.

Maybe I'm just a dreamer, a teenage in a disguise of a grown up man but I want
to belive that I'm doing the right thing.

## The problem

I live in Uruguay. A country that's getting known because of it openness,
political, cultural and economical.

* Open source > closed source in every goverment call
* Every citizen is an organ donor by default
* You have the right to marry whoever you want
* You have the right to die if you want
* Marihuana it's legal
* One Laptop Per Child
* No official religion

I'm proud on what my country achieved in the last decade but I also look around
me, and my neighbor is having a bad time.

Argentina regulations are getting tougher by the minute and now a new one
started to ban access to certain websites, being the first one The Pirate Bay.

## The idea

I'm obsessed with freedom

## The server

I had this 1U HP server for a while. I always knew that I could use it for
something great. So I ordered some special RAM for it and now this baby has 8GB
and 2 Opteron CPUs.
