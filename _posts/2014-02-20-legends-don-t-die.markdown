Today is a sad sad day. Today is the day that Jim Weirich died.

This is my way of handling the grief:

> He was that way. A long time before the gender wars, even before concurrency
> debate there was this man. He saw in you stuff that you couldn't find in the
> mirror.

> He was that way. Even in your darkest time he would see light in you. Having
> an intellect more developed than any other person he will just shine with his
> laugh.

> He was that way. After being part of the internet for so long he always wanted
> to give eveyone a chance, you could always learn something from him... from
> yourself.

> I know it's hard for you to understand. I know that everyone around you rants
> and criticize everything you say. I know that people around you enjoy trying
> to look better than you, belive me... I know.

> But the world was different back then, it's fisically the same planet but a
> lot changed. People focus on their differences now, they look for every single
> detail that makes them different trying to ignore the absurd amount of things
> that makes all of us the same.

> He was not that way. He had the curiosity of a child, their innocence, their
> love.

> He was not that way. He shared every single thing he knew, not for profit, for
> fun.

> He was not that way. He smiled and give you his opinion with respect, not for
> fame, but for a greater good.

> I know it's hard for you to understand how hard is the pain to see a world
> without him. But I know that you can be as amazing as he was because now you
> have a part of him. Now you know who he was and how important is to be a good
> person.

> You are not going to meet the man, you will listen to his legend. And legends
> don't die.

> You are standing on the shoulders of a kind giant... now aim higher.

Some people want to live forever but only a few will.
Jim is one of those people.

Every time someone will run `rake` or just think about testing he will be there.
Inspiring all of us.

All the blogpost written today talk about his kindness and about the way he made
everyone he touched a better person.

I'm lucky enough to have shared some time with him, working, learning, laughing.

Thank you kind giant, now sleep.
