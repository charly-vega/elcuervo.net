I have the tendency to balance my full nerd side with nature. Camping really far
away with the bare minimum. I like to go off the grid.

Not so many years ago we lived without checking on Foursquare, without telling
what we were doing on Twitter or who is our partner on Facebook. We even lived
without sms. Only with spare change in our pockets and ideas in our minds.

The digital revolution came and we went from connecting to the internet some
times of the day, to struggle to disconnect some times of the day.
We now are premanently on-the-grid.

Since I was born in a third world country where access to information was limited
having nowdays the ability to be constantly connected felt awesome. All the information of
mankind in one place. I could learn anything, free, I just needed to spend some
time and I could learn the most complex networking papers or read the most touching
poems.

Other problems araised, we started to get confused with the amount of
communication we had... started to think that it was actual connection:

But like with everything there's a trade off. Not everyone looked at the
internet as an information source, a lot looked at it as an oportuniy but a
handful of them started this ancient trend of privacy invasion.

We now know that a lot of goverments are eager to know everything we do.
Obviously this is not limited to goverments but also companies, from small ones
to mega corporations.

It does not matter if you use Windows, Linux or OSX you are on the grid and you
know it. There's no **real** freedom out there. Because it's not about the
software you use, it's how you use it and in our specific case how you build it.

Security bugs and also the backdoor kind exist in a ton of software and even in
hardware. The curiosity to know and the interest to do so is a powerful hand
that does not care about software or hardware.

Free of choice, free of thought, free of discrimination, of persecution. I do
not accept the **one true way of living** ideals.
able to run it.

I've started coding PHP, but I'm no PHP dev. I've worked with Python, but I'm no
Python dev. Most of my career is around Ruby, but I'm no Ruby dev.
I'm a developer. I love to code anything, in any language.

And I'm not tied to any OS, I'm writing this in OSX but I own several machines
with several OSs. I enjoy being a poweruser in any system, as well as other
people.

My war today is against people who want to tell me how to think, how to feel.
Against people who wants to tag me and use me in a statistic.

My war today is against the ones who think their way is the only way, because
once there was only one acceptable gender of one acceptable color and one
acceptable faith.

Sometimes enough is enough. Sometimes a part of you can't take things anymore.
Sometimes you are not going to wait for someone to fix things. Sometimes it has
to be you.

Being a programmer is by far the most important thing that I achieved in my
life.

Some things inspire you to go the extra mile. Some things trigger that part of
you that was asleep. Some things happen all over again.

These words made me realize something. This is not the first time this happened,
some things in our world are repetitive.

These acts of rebeldy are a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. But
that is not a barrier to battle the brutality.

**Anarchy** _comes from the ancient Greek ἀναρχία, anarchia, from
ἀν an, "not, without" + ἀρχός arkhos, "ruler", meaning "absence of a ruler",
"without rulers")_

Anarchy is not only a political view, but also a philosofical one.
Anarchy is often tied with violence, with hate.
I'm seeing a world of violence, with hate.

I don't want to have the one true way of living. I want to dedicate my life to
give everyone the chance to choose, to love, to hate to be free in all extent.

I might be in the wrong path... but this time, this time I choosed this path and
I'm going to defend it.
