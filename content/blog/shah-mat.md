We'll always need kings because we'll always need wars.

For the most advanced species in our known universe we are pretty dumb aren't
we?

It's like our tail bone, we are far from our time with a tail but it's still
there reminding us our tree-hugging time. Evolution takes time, change takes
time we all know it but after some millenia we are still attempting to please
someone by fear or respect.

We want to kill the king just to be one. Our monkey brains still need an alpha,
our monkey brains still want to be an alpha.

Fortunately we came a long way in the discussion department and nowdays it's
less common to take things as we want them without thinking in the consecuences.

But we still want wars it fits in our mind it's easy to understand it's
primitive like we are.

We think that wars give us purpose, that they are solution. We force our minds
to think in black and white, good an evil, we and them instead of seeing the
shades, the gaps.

Change takes time but somehow even recognizing that most of people understand
that nothing gets build in the next morning brutal change seems like a good
idea.

"Let's destroy X, everything will be better" they said, without even realizing
that something will fill the void. Rational and incremental change is the only
way that humanity had reached somewhere.

Missdirection is the main tool for illusionists and the core of modern politics.

We want wars, we choose wars. Wars on gender, religion, food, politics, sports.
Every day we choose "war" instead of "change" we want someone to die because
they not share our current mindset.

You changed, you thought that one thing was correct 10 years ago, you probably
think that you were a moron.
People need time, patience. Radical ideas are just regular ideas with problems
of self esteem.

Shāh Māt is the word that eventually will become checkmate. Is Farsi's for
"The King is helpless".

We have an outstanding amount of things in common, one of them is being
helpless, all of us.

In some dark cold nights we can't avoid the feeling of helplessness and feeling
insignificant in the black sky.

You want to change the world but not change with it. Guess what? everyone wants
that but the next time just remember that the person in front of you with that
idea that you find repulsive feels the same as you and maybe, just maybe you are
not in oposite sides of a war but in the same planet wanting the same things in
slightly different angles.

Stop using "war" for things that are not wars, destroying only brings more chaos
be open for change. Ideas will not die, they can evolve, let that rival rest and
le their ideas change alonside yours.
